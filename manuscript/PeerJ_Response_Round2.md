#Response To Review

> Thanks Nick for the careful review. The figures have been significantly tightened up - thanks for pushing me to do this! They are much better as a result!

The author has included a justification for why he chose these three tools for the ORP as opposed to any other of the myriad of different tools. I'd like to see a reference to the description of the characteristics of these tools in the introduction put in here so a reader who did not read the introduction knows where to look for this summary information!

> I am not exactly sure where Nick want's additional info added. There is some discussion about why the specific tools were used in the introduction. Similar justification is also in the methods, section 2.4, starting on line 130. While I value agree that making papers easier to digest is important, having the same info duplicated three times seems to be excessive.

All Figures: I don't like the axes used in many of the figures - axes should span the entire range of the data and have a defined intercept.

> I have modified all of the figures. Axes should at this point be more acceptable.

Figure 1: no axis labels - I realise the axes are not really meaningful for MDS plots but the labels should at least state what is being plotted - MDS parameter1 vs MDS parameter 2.

> I have added axis labels to figure 1.

Figure 2 & 3: no axis labels (see above) - also might be better shown as a single tall figure with one column and two/three rows with the panels one above another and a shared x axis.

> I have added axis labels. Additionally, I have changed the layout as suggested.

Figure 4: The captions doesn't really walk me through the figure so I'd like that expanded. Also, there are one very tiny lack points plotted on top of and underneath the violin plots - are these the data themselves, or some specific added dashed lines? What do these points mean? If they are intentional, they should be descried in the caption and made more obvious (thicker lines, large markers). If not, they should be removed.

> I have beefed up the figure description to make the figure more easily understood. I admit to not being able to see the 'lack points' that Nick is referring to. I have in general cleaned up the figure, so hopefully I have resolved this issue.  

Figure 5: I really don't like Joy plots (yes, I know they are the rage and people think they look cool, but...). Different panels of a figure in a scientific should not overlap - they should have their own labelled axis with a scale on. Only for a situation where the figure with separate panels would absolutely not fit on a page could I see an argument for Joy plots in a serious paper over just multi-panel plots - and we're not so tight on space here. These plots need re-drawing and multi-panel distribution plots.

> In have modified the Joy plot to make them non overlapping - which should resolve the major issue. I understand that Nick does not appreciate the aesthetics of joyplots, an opinion he is welcome to hold. I am of the opinion that they are a nice way to visualize and compare distributions. Even ugly plots can accurately represent data!

 The conclusion section is completely lacking in quantitative detail and repeats much of what has been said earlier in the paper. I'd suggest either removing it completely or, if you want to keep it (or the journal require it), then be precise and quantitative in it. Where does ORP do better and y how much does it do better.

 > I have removed this section. I agree that it added nothing.
